Web form creation for animal shelters, and a quick survey that can be shared via QR code, linked to this website. 
This survey is about collecting general statistics of a person's preferences when adopting a pet. It won't be specific, but it'll be a start to proceed with more specific questions down the line.

<!------>

This survey will collect information efficiently with short questions and short answers. 
Each question is simple to go through, and it collects enough data to do a general analysis on whether or not the physical and visible features of an animal is a variable to adoption. 
Not many people want to read a lot of words when taking a quick survey, therefore making it short and sweet is more attractive than a long and lengthy one. 
It's also easy to open and read off of a thinner or more condensed screen, therefore it's better for mobile users when they complete the survey.
